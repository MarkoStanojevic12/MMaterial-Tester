# Material-Qt :rocket:
A fully custom QML library built on the Material design scheme

## Purpose :thinking:
The purpose of the library is to simplify everyday Qt use, to make apps look stunning without much effort. 
And to learn and improve along the way! All contributions (comments and code) are very welcome.

## Recommendation :point_up:
Take a look at the MaterialTester app, it is not only showing all the components but also how to use them. ( Simplified examples coming soon )

## Dependencies :dependabot:
Qt6::Quick, Qt::Gui
Since Tag 1.1 (Qt 6.7+)

# Advantages
